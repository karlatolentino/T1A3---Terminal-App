## System and Hardware Requirements

## Testing
For my terminal application *Barber's Paradise*, I created a spreadsheet to manually test the functions of my program.

Due to insufficient time, I was unable to complete and pass testing for user input in the **Record Haircut** feature where the user is prompted input for date and guard number. The program will still take and record user input as data and will display in the history.

**Please refer to the manual testing spreadsheet located in (./docs/manual_testing_spreadsheet.xlsx)**

Take me [there](./docs/manual_testing_spreadsheet.xlsx). Open in Microsoft Excel or Numbers.
Or open the PDF version [here](./docs/manual_testing_spreadsheet1.pdf).
